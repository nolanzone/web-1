    <h1>Bonus Exercise</h1>
            <h2>website building aspirations</h2>
<hr/>
            <p><b>Before taking this program, i did not think id be interested in writing code, but after diving into it, I do have some ideas that i think would be really cool to learn:</b></p>
<ul>
        <li>understanding all the common tags <i>(make a cheat sheet)</i></li>
    <li>writing code for my own web-portfolio</li>
    <li>learn how to write code for animated scrolling</li>
</ul>
            <h5>learning animated scrolling would definitely be on the more advanced side of things, but seeing into how it can be done would be fun to observe
<b/>
                here is a website with  an animated scrolling that I think is neat:
